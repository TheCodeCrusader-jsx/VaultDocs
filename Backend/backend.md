# 🗃️ VaultDocs - Document Submission & Tracking Backend API

VaultDocs is a Node.js-based backend API designed to simplify and automate **document submission, tracking, and management**, often used in hiring, internships, or education platforms. The system allows users to upload documents, track their approval status, and download them when needed.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of VaultDocs is to provide a clean and extendable backend API that:
- Accepts document uploads securely.
- Stores document metadata (name, status, upload date).
- Allows admin (or automated service) to update document statuses.
- Supports downloading previously uploaded documents.
- Can be integrated with any frontend (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
